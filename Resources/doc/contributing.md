## Coding standards

Your PRs must adhere to the [Symfony2 Coding Standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).
The easiest way to apply to these conventions is to install [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer)
and the [Opensky Symfony2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/opensky/Symfony2-coding-standard).

**Happy coding** !


## Things you might want to work on:

- Add tests! This package is still undergoing huge refactorings in short periods of time (this is another reason why the
version hasn't reached `1.0` yet), but tests should be completed now to solidify the codebase.
- Further extend documentation, especially the [library's](https://github.com/displayce/slack).
